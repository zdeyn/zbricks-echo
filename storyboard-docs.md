Sure thing, let's make this more entertaining with a snide, know-it-all Narrator and a confused, basic zBrick.

### Video 1: "This is a zBrick"

**Storyboard Cue:**
*Fade in, showing a blue zBrick standing on an X on the floor, looking bored and slightly vacant*

**Narrator:** 
"This... is a zBrick."

**Storyboard Cue:**
*zBrick startles and blinks*

**zBrick:**  
"Oh! Hi!.. Who.. who are.. you?"

**Narrator:**  
(dead-pan dry sarcasm) "I'm the Narrator - I explain things."

**zBrick:**  
(relieved) "Nice to meet you, Narrator - I'm.. I'm.. uhh.. who am.. uh.. I?"

**Narrator:**  
(deadpan) "Like I said earlier - you're a zBrick."

**zBrick:**  
(puzzled) "..."

**Narrator:**  
(sighs) "A zBrick can do three main things: answer questions, follow orders, and watch, react to and send events. (mumbling: and a fourth, throw a tantru-.. Uhh.. /cough/ raise an exception... but we won't talk about that now)"

**Query Section:**
- **Narrator:** (brightly, but slowly) "A query (or question, for those catching up) asks the zBrick something, like 'What color are you?' - and the zBrick answers:"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *cut-out zQuery swings in on bad ropes/wires, and pokes zBrick with a sign reading "What color are you?"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick gets scared, looks confused, and hides*
- **Narrator:** (slowly, but firmly) "... And the zBrick... answers..."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zQuery gets pulled backwards out-of-scene, reloading, while zBrick /coughs/, stands, dusts self off and stands back on the X on the floor*
- **Narrator:** (brightly, starting over) "A query asks the zBrick something, like 'What color are you?' - and the zBrick answers:"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *cut-out zQuery swings in on bad ropes/wires, and pokes zBrick with a sign reading "What color are you?"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *pop-up cardboard speech bubble falls from the ceiling, bobbing next to zBrick - "I'm blue!"*
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick looks at zQuery, looks at the speech bubble sign, and finally puts 2 and 2 together...*
- **zBrick:** (excited) "OHHHHHH I know this one! I'm blue!"
- **Narrator:** (echoes of slow golf-clap) "Well done, little zBrick. Well done..."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *Fade to back - end section*

-----

**Command Section:**
- **Narrator:** (patronizing) "A command tells the zBrick to change something, like 'Change color to green.' Even you can do that, right?"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick changes color to green and shows a speech bubble saying "Now I'm green!"*
- **zBrick:** (proud) "Look! I did it! Now I'm green!"

**Event Section:**
- **Narrator:** (bored) "An event tells us something that has happened, like 'Color changed to green.'"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick shows a speech bubble saying "My color changed to green!"*
- **zBrick:** (enthusiastic) "Hey! My color changed to green!"

**Q&A Section:**
- **Narrator:** (mockingly) "What if the zBrick can't answer the query or can't do the command? Bet you didn't think of that."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick shows a speech bubble saying "Error: I can't do that!"*
- **zBrick:** (confused) "Uhh.. Error: I can't do that?"

**Conclusion:**
- **Narrator:** (sarcastically cheerful) "Commands change the state, queries ask about the state, and events report changes. That's a zBrick! Got it?"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *zBrick waves goodbye*
- **zBrick:** (happy) "Goodbye! Thanks, Narrator!"

### Video 2: "Two zBricks - Watching for Events and Sending Events"

**Storyboard Cue:**
*Fade in, showing two zBricks standing next to each other*

**Narrator:**  
"This time, we have two zBricks! They can talk to each other using queries, commands, and events. Isn't that fascinating?"

**Query Section:**
- **Narrator:** (condescending) "One zBrick can ask the other a query, like 'What color are you?' It's just basic communication."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *First zBrick asks, second zBrick shows a speech bubble saying "I'm blue!"*
- **zBrick 1:** (confused) "What color are you?"
- **zBrick 2:** (enthusiastic) "I'm blue!"

**Command Section:**
- **Narrator:** (patronizing) "One zBrick can send a command to the other, like 'Change color to blue.' Let's see if they manage that."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *First zBrick sends a command, second zBrick changes color to blue and shows a speech bubble saying "Now I'm blue!"*
- **zBrick 1:** (tentative) "Change color to blue."
- **zBrick 2:** (proud) "Now I'm blue!"

**Event Section:**
- **Narrator:** (bored) "One zBrick can send an event to the other, like 'Color changed to blue.' Let's see this thrilling interaction."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *First zBrick sends an event, second zBrick reacts with a speech bubble saying "Noted, color changed to blue!"*
- **zBrick 1:** (excited) "Color changed to blue!"
- **zBrick 2:** (acknowledging) "Noted, color changed to blue!"

**Q&A Section:**
- **Narrator:** (mockingly) "What if something goes wrong? What if a zBrick can't do what it's asked? Don't panic."
- **Storyboard Cue:** *Second zBrick shows a speech bubble saying "Error: I can't do that!"*
- **zBrick 2:** (confused) "Error: I can't do that?"

**Conclusion:**
- **Narrator:** (sarcastically cheerful) "zBricks can talk to each other using queries, commands, and events. They watch for events and react to them. That's how zBricks work together! Simple, right?"
- **Storyboard Cue:** *Both zBricks wave goodbye*
- **zBrick 1:** (happy) "Goodbye!"
- **zBrick 2:** (happy) "Thanks, Narrator!"
